# FRIDA
routines/binaries of the FRIDA code.

The FRIDA (FRee-boundary Integro-Differential Axisimmetric) code expoits a coupled Finite Element Method – Boundary Element Method (FEM-BEM) approach for the solution of the free-boundary axi-symmetric plasma equilibrium problem (i.e., the Grad-Shafranov equation).

## Compiling mex functions
A list of compatible compilers can be found at these links ([Windows](https://it.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers.html), [Linux](https://it.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers-linux.html), [Mac](https://it.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers-mac.html)). Some functions are written in Fortran 90 and compiled into Matlab-compatible mex functions, and some native Matlab functions are traislated into mex functions using a C++ compiler, thus both compilers need to be installed to properly compile all the routines. However, the instuctions for Fortran and C++ code are kept separate, to ease things for who want to use only one of them.

To compile Fortran 90 code run `this_script.m`

To compile some native matlab functions into C++ mex funcitons run `that_script.m`
